# JL-comp-challenge-1
This project is an ode to Frank Reynolds from Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia. I tried to use the same icons as the orginal comp while changing up the color pallette and the image. There's a hover state on the small articles that changes the opacity and multiple break points so the site is optimized for computers, tablets and phones.
